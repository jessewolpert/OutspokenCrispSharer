How To Use It
  When an empty bowl is placed on the centre of a table, the sharing begins
  The Outspoken Crisp Sharer asks people to fill the bowl with crisps
  When the bowl is full the first person may take a crisp through the single opening of the cage
  The cage is then turned to face the next person who may take the same number of crisps or more
  This continues until all the crisps are finished
  The Outspoken Crisp Sharer has a variety of personalities and decision making processes
 

How It Works
  At the centre of the table is a sensitive weighing scale
  The table is silent until a bowl is placed in its centre
  The table interacts with the particpants through speech. 
  It moves its cage around the bowl. Depending on what happens on the scale it can:
    Start the sharing once its bowl is full
    Check how many crisps are taken compared to the previous turn and move the cage accordingly
    Finish the sharing once the bowl is empty
    Request for its bowl to be filled
